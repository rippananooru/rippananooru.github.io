Hi there welcome to nooru.me 

Here's is my static page created using jekyll (Ruby) hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I'm making this to learn about static site generators and how github pages work. 

It's been fun so far! Why don't you try it too? it's free.

If you have any question or interested in making site like this head over to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Or you can ask me any questions on my social media. Don't worry I'm friendly.

**github page is cool!!**
