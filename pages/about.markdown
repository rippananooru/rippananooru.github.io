Hi there welcome to {{ site.title }}

Here's is my static page created using jekyll (Ruby) hosted on [Github-Pages].

I'm making this to learn about static site generators and how github pages work. 

It's been fun so far! Why don't you try it too? It's free.

If you have any question or interested in making site like this head over to [Github-Pages].

Or you can ask me any questions on my social media. Don't worry I'm friendly.

Here's my online version of [resume] if you interested to hire me.

**Github page is cool!!**
