<h1> Hi there welcome to<br> {{ site.title }}</h1>
<h4>Thanks for spending your precious time coming here.</h4>

<p>
Here's is my static page created using jekyll (Ruby) hosted on Github-Pages. <br><br>
I'm making this to learn about static site generators and how github pages work. <br><br>
It's been fun so far! Why don't you try it too? It's free. <br><br>
If you have any question or interested in making site like this head over to Github-Pages. <br><br>
Or you can ask me any questions on my social media. Don't worry I'm friendly. <br><br>
Here's my online version of resume if you interested to hire me. <br><br>
